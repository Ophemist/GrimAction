// The live half of camera collision: issues one GAME::Level::GetIntersection against the camera's
// current region and reports the hit distance to the offline spring-arm model.
//
// This is the first code in this project that calls a game function from inside a hooked game
// function. The re-entrancy policy recorded in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md governs it in full:
//  - the caller must invoke this only after the original UpdateFromInputImpl has returned;
//  - the level pointer is NEVER cached, it is re-fetched through both accessors on every query;
//  - every call is wrapped in a narrow structured-exception guard;
//  - a refused query is a fault for the model to count, never a silent zero.
//
// Thread affinity was live-confirmed: the camera callback owner is the game's own primary thread,
// which is the thread that mutates level geometry, so a torn read is not a hazard here.
